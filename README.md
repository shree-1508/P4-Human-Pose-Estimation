# AICTE Internship - Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning(P4)

Welcome to the AICTE- Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham – A joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP, focusing on AI Technologies Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning (P4) Internship repository! This project focuses on human pose estimation using OpenCV and MediaPipe, along with motion detection capabilities. It also includes a Streamlit-based web app for pose estimation visualization.

## 📄 File Descriptions

### `Estimation_app.py`

This file contains a **Streamlit** app that performs **human pose estimation** on images. It uses a **TensorFlow** model and **OpenCV** to detect human body parts and visualize the pose.

#### Features:
- Upload an image for pose estimation.
- Detection threshold slider for customizing detection sensitivity.
- Display original image and pose estimation results.

### `Module2-Image.py`

This script uses **MediaPipe** to perform pose estimation on a static image. It detects keypoints like joints and limbs, then visualizes them.

#### Features:
- Image loading and processing.
- Pose landmarks and connections drawn on the image.
- Visual feedback of detected poses.

### `Module2-Video.py`

This file performs pose estimation on videos using **MediaPipe**. It captures video frames, processes them, and draws pose landmarks and connections.

#### Features:
- Process video frames in real-time .
- Pose detection with **Mediapipe Pose**.
- Display the video with landmarks and connections.

### `MotionDetection.py`

This script demonstrates basic **motion detection** using **OpenCV**. It reads an image, processes it, and allows saving the result to the filesystem.

#### Features:
- Image reading and motion detection.
- Save processed images.

### `app.py`

A basic **Streamlit** app to get started. It simply displays a welcoming message.

#### Features:
- Title and description display.

### `test.py`

Verifies if **MediaPipe** is correctly installed and working.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Pose Estimation (Image)
1. Launch the app by running `Estimation_app.py`.
2. Upload an image and adjust the detection threshold.
3. View the pose estimation results in real-time.

### Pose Estimation (Video)
1. Modify the `Module2-Video.py` to provide the path to your video.
2. Run the script, and it will display the processed video with pose landmarks.

### Motion Detection
1. Use `MotionDetection.py` to test basic motion detection on images.
2. Process and save the results to the filesystem.
